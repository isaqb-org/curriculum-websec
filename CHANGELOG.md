# Release Notes
## Initial Release 2020.1
This is a new curriculum in the iSAQB Advanced Level portfolio.
It covers how to integrate security into your analysis and development lifecycle with a technical focus on web-based systems

Security cannot be considered independently of the context in which the systems are used.
The reference to web applications, information systems, or embedded systems limits the thematic focus
and ensures that the relevant information for the security of the respective systems is communicated.
The curriculum focuses on web applications, but content about embedded systems or information systems
can be inserted at the relevant points instead.
